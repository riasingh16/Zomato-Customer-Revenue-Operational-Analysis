### Insights 
#### 1. Revenue and Sales Performance:
  - The top five dishes account for **37%** of the **total revenue** over the analysis period. This significant contribution indicates that a **small selection of popular 
    items** drives a **large share of Zomato's income**.

  - It turns out that the top dishes ordered by both **frequent** and **infrequent** customers are strikingly similar. Dishes like **Chicken Biryani, Pasta Alfredo, Paneer 
    Butter Masala, Masala Dosa,** and **Mutton Rogan Josh** dominate both segments. This overlap suggests that these dishes have a universal appeal, resonating with a wide 
    range of customer types.

  - **High-value customers**, making up **25%** of the customer base, were found to have a substantial impact on Zomato's performance. These top-tier customers placed an 
    average of **757 orders** and generated **$253,134** in revenue each, significantly outperforming the "Regular" customer group.

  - In contrast, the remaining **75% of customers** were categorized as **Regular**, each generating below the threshold of **$243,223** in revenue and **733 orders**, indicating lower engagement and revenue.

  #### 2. Customer Behavior and Preferences

- **Chicken Biryani** is consistently among the **top 3 dishes** across **all time slots** (Breakfast, Dinner, and Midnight Snack), showcasing its broad appeal throughout the day. Additionally, **vegetarian options** like **Paneer Butter Masala and Masala Dosa** rank highly during **Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner**, indicating their strong customer preference during peak dining times.
- The **Midnight Snack** category has **low demand** (with orders generally under 50) , with **Masala Dosa** being the **most ordered** at **43 orders**, indicating a smaller but loyal customer base for late-night meals.
- **Bengaluru** and **Delhi** have the most **robust late-night restaurant scenes**, accounting for **51.41%** of all late-night restaurants in the dataset (21 out of 41). This prominence could be attributed to their larger, younger, and more diverse populations, which drive higher demand for late-night dining.
- The **low percentages** in cities like **Hyderabad, Chennai,** and **Ahmedabad** suggest an opportunity to expand late-night offerings to meet potential untapped demand.
